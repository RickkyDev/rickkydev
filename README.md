### What I like:
💻 Since I was little, technology always made my eyes shine, technology is something that I'm really interested in, not just programming, but stuff like Linux, computer hardware, graphical and UI design, video making, and a lot more.

<br>
🏎️ Motorsport too is a thing that I have interest and love since I was a little kid, speed, adrenaline and the insides of racing and normal cars always made me so curious and interested in everything this car world has to offer.

🎵 Something that makes me live the present and be calm on a stressful day is music, I'm a big music enthusiast, do not know much about, but if you show me anything from a simple amp to a complex mixing desk, I'll be thrilled to know more technical details about it.
